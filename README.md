# finally-206-project-
For my final project I have decided to use Yelp and Google Maps. In order to run my program, you must open my finalproject.py and finalproject_test.py files. The code to run my project is inside finalproject.py, my test cases are in finalproject_test.py, and the code for the websites that are needed to open the map from google maps are in the 4 html files in the templates folder.

Once you have those files open, run finalproject.py in terminal. You will be asked to enter a search term. In this prompt, you can enter anything you desire. Examples include but are not limited to: bars, mexican, italian food, food, etc. any restaurant or bar type you are looking for you can enter here.

You will then be prompted to enter the name of a location. In this prompt, you can enter the city you are looking to research. Examples include: New York, Chicago, Rome, Florence, etc. 

You will then be given 4 links for your search results. The first one will give you the highest rated restaurants and bars, the second one will give you the lowest rated restaurants and bars, the third one will give you the most expensive restaurants and bars, and the last one will give you the least expensive restaurants or bars in the area you are searching in. Here you are also told how to exit the program- by pressing the Control and C keys.

The user must then copy and paste one of the links into their browser. Once they do that, they will be taken to a site with a map. This map will be of the city that they searched for and will have drop pins on the locations of the restaurants in the category. For example, if a user entered "food" "ann arbor" and copied and pasted the html for the highest rated restaurants and bars, they would be taken to a map of ann arbor with drop pins on the location of the top 5 highest rated restaurants in Ann Arbor. The user can zoom in and zoom out on the graph as he pleases.

Each drop pin has a number (1-5) that corresponds to information in terminal. Once the user copies and pastes the URL into their broswer and opens the site, they can go back to terminal and see more information on their search. For example, when they open the URL for the highest rated restaurants in ann arbor, and go back to terminal, they will see the title "highest rated restaurants and bars" and underneath this there will be the top 5 restaurants in ann arbor (with the numbers listed corresponding to the numbers on the map they opened) and the rating of the restaurant. For each of the 4 links opened in a web browser, the same format of information will be availible in terminal. 

The user can then exit the program and rerun it to enter a new search term.
Hope my project helps people to find new places to eat and others to avoid!
